Scaleway's key Manager allows you to create [data encryption keys (DEK)](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/concepts/#data-encryption-key-(dek)) to encrypt and decrypt your [payload](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/concepts/#payload).

You can then use your Key Manager key to encrypt your DEK.

    <Message type="important">
     You are responsible for storing your DEKS, as Key Manager does not store them for you.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Created](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/how-to/create-km-key/) a Key Manager key

## How to create and manage a data encryption key (DEK)

1. Click Key Manager in the **Security and Identity section** of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. Your keys display.
2. Click the key for which to create a data encryption key.
3. Scroll down to the **Generate data encryption key** section.
4. Click **Generate data encryption key**. A pop-up displays with the [ciphertext](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/concepts/#ciphertext) of your DEK.
5. Copy and store your DEK's ciphertext safely.
    <Message type="important">
     As Key Manager does not store your DEKs, we recommend that you **always store the ciphertext** of your data encryption key rather than its [plaintext](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/concepts/#plaintext).

6. Optionally, click **Display plaintext** to make sure that the plaintext does not contain any mistakes.
7. Click **Close**.
