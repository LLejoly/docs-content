## Asymmetric encryption

Asymmetric encryption is a fundamental type of cryptographic method used to secure data with a pair of keys: a **public key** and a **private key**.

The public key is used for encryption and can be shared openly, while the private key is used for decryption and must be kept secret. This design eliminates the need to share a single key securely, which is a challenge in symmetric encryption.

Asymmetric encryption is particularly well-suited for secure communication and authentication, such as encrypting emails or verifying digital signatures. However, it is slower than symmetric encryption. Algorithms like RSA and ECC are common examples of asymmetric encryption.

## Ciphertext

Ciphertext refers to data that has been encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm and a key.

Unlike [plaintext](#plaintext), ciphertext is not human-readable and cannot be understood or used without first decrypting it with the appropriate decryption key.

## Data encryption key (DEK)

A data encryption key is a type of key that has a single purpose: encrypting and decrypting a [payload](#payload).

DEKs are generated on-demand, and are then encrypted by a [key encryption key](#key-encryption-key-(kek)) before being forwarded to the user.

DEKs are not stored in Key Manager, but by the recipient. The lifecycle of a DEK typically follows the lifecycle of the payload:

1. A new DEK is generated for each payload that needs encryption.
2. The DEK is disposed of as soon as the payload becomes irrelevant.

## Encryption method

An encryption method is a process used to convert readable data ([plaintext](#plaintext)) into an unreadable format ([ciphertext](#ciphertext)) to protect its confidentiality.

There are two types of encryption methods:

- [Symmetric encryption](#symmetric-encryption)
- [Asymmetric encrytpion](#asymmetric-encryption)

## Key encryption key (KEK)

A key encryption key (KEK) is a type of key that has a single purpose: encrypting and decrypting [data encryption keys](#data-encryption-key-(dek)).

The KEK is permanently stored in Scaleway's Key Manager and never leaves it. It cannot be accessed by anyone, and should be [rotated](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/api-cli/rotate-keys-api-cli/) regularly.

## Key management

Key management is the process of handling keys used in cryptographic systems to ensure the security and integrity of your cryptographic operations. This includes the generation, exchange, storage, usage, and disposal of these keys.
Although strong cipher algorithms allow you to protect your information with secret keys, your data is only protected as long as your encryption keys are kept secret from non-authorized individuals.

## Key protection

Key protection allows your key to be used and modified, but not deleted. This provides an additional layer of security.

## Key rotation

Key rotation is the process of replacing an old cryptographic key with a new one. It is a critical practice in key management to minimize the risk of exposure if a key is compromised and to enhance the overall security and resilience of your systems.

When using [symmetric encryption](#symmetric-encryption), it is generally recommended to rotate keys every 30 to 90 days.

After rotating your Key Manager keys, all cryptographic operations will use the new rotated keys. All data encrypted with former key versions will remain decipherable with the former key.

## Key usage

The key usage specifies the **algorithm** used to create subsequent key versions, and the **scope of cryptographic operations** supported by your key encryption key.
You must define a key usage upon key creation. As of now, Key Manager **only supports symmetric encryption**.

## Payload

A payload refers to the core data or message being transmitted, processed, or protected. It is the information of interest that encryption or other security mechanisms aim to secure.

## Plaintext

Plaintext refers to unencrypted, readable data. In the context of key management, plaintext often refers to cryptographic keys or sensitive data that are stored or transmitted in an unencrypted form. This term is often used in contrast to ciphertext, which is data that has been encrypted and is not readable without decryption.

## Region

A Region refers to the **geographical location** in which your key will be created. **Each region contains multiple Availability Zones**. Your key will be duplicated on **all Availability Zones** of the selected region. Scaleway is available in the Paris, Amsterdam, and Warsaw regions.

## Root encryption key (REK)

A root encryption key (REK) is another type of key that has the single purpose of encrypting and decrypting KEKs in order to store them in hard storage. Scaleway's Key Manager has one REK per region, which is securely stored in our facilities.

## Symmetric encryption

Symmetric encryption is a fundamental type of cryptographic method where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data. This means that the sender and receiver must have access to the same secret key, which they use to secure their communication.

Because symmetric encryption relies on a single key, it is generally fast and ideal for encrypting large volumes of data. However, its security depends entirely on keeping the key confidential.

Symmetric encryption algorithms like AES are widely used in scenarios where speed and efficiency are critical. Key manager supports the `AES_256_GCM` symmetric encryption algorithm.
