**Commitment Plan for Apple silicon** is a flexible pricing option that allows customers to choose between a fully flexible pay-as-you-go pricing or a long-term monthly commitment period for their Apple silicon servers.
By committing to a plan, you can enjoy better rates compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. The commitment period can be adjusted or cancelled at any time after the initial commitment, providing flexibility to adapt to changing workload requirements.
At the end of your initial commitment period, you can switch back to a no-commitment plan. By switching back to pay-as-you-go pricing the standard fare for your Mac mini will be billed.
