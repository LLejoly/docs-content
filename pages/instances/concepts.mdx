## Availability Zone

An Availability Zone is an isolated location within a specific region, providing dedicated infrastructure and services. For example, `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, and `fr-par-3` are Availability Zones within the Paris region.

For a comprehensive list of regions and their corresponding Availability Zones, refer to our [Product Availability Guide](/account/reference-content/products-availability/).

## Block volumes

Block volumes offer network-attached storage that can be attached or detached from Instances like a virtual hard drive. They behave like traditional disks and can expand the storage capacity of an Instance.

## Boot-on-Block

<Macro id="storage-boot-on-block" />

## Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)

Scaleway used a 1:1 carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT) setup for legacy Instance types. Unlike standard CGNAT, where multiple users share a single public IP, this setup ensured that each Instance had a unique NAT IP mapped to a unique public IP. This preserved IP exclusivity and prevented connectivity issues.

All recent Instance types support routed IPs through [IP Mobility](#ip-mobility).

## Cloud-init

Cloud-init is a multi-distribution package that [enables boot-time customization for cloud servers](/instances/how-to/use-boot-modes/#how-to-use-cloud-init). It allows automatic Instance configuration upon boot, transforming a generic Ubuntu image into a fully configured server within seconds.

## Cost-Optimized Instances

[Cost-Optimized Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cost-optimized-instances/) are production-grade Instances designed for scalable infrastructures. They support the boot-on-block feature and allow high-performance services with high-end CPUs.

## Development Instances

[Development Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cost-optimized-instances/) are reliable and flexible Instances designed for hosting websites, applications, and development environments.

## Dynamic IP

A dynamic IP is a public IP address that is released back into the general pool when an Instance is stopped. When the Instance is restarted, it may receive a different dynamic IP.

This differs from [Flexible IPs](#flexible-ip), which remain associated with an Instance even when it is stopped. Dynamic IPs can only be assigned via the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/instance/). Learn more in our [Billing FAQ](/faq/billing/#when-does-the-billing-of-an-instance-start-and-stop).

## Flexible IP

Flexible IPs are public IP addresses that can be held independently of any Instance. By default, Scaleway Instances are assigned a Flexible IP. These IPs can be detached and reassigned to different Instances as needed.

For more details, see our guide on [Using Flexible IP Addresses](/instances/how-to/use-flexips/).

## GPU Instances

[GPU Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/) are powerful Instances equipped with high-end Nvidia GPUs. See our [dedicated GPU documentation](/gpu/) for details.

## Image

An image is a complete backup of an Instance, containing all its [volumes](#volumes). It can be used to restore an Instance or create multiple Instances with the same configuration. For backing up a single volume, use the [snapshot](#snapshot) feature instead.

## Instance

An Instance is a virtual computing unit with dedicated resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. Different Instance types cater to various workloads. See our [Instance Types Documentation](/instances/reference-content/choosing-instance-type/) for details.

## InstantApp

An InstantApp is a pre-installed application image. Choosing an InstantApp during [Instance creation](/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) enables immediate use of the application.

## IP Mobility

IP Mobility eliminates the need for NAT IPs. Instead, the public IP is routed directly to the Instance, ensuring the IP remains unchanged during stop/start operations or migration to a different hypervisor.

<Message type="note">
  Your IP address remains the same only if you use a Flexible IP. Instances with Dynamic IPs will still receive a new IP upon restart.
</Message>

## Learning Instances

[Learning Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/stardust-instances/) are ideal for small workloads and simple applications. You can create one Instance per Availability Zone (available in `fr-par-1` and `nl-ams-1`).

## Local volumes

Local volumes are SSD-based storage solutions hosted on the local hypervisor. Their size is fixed and depends on the Instance type. Some Instances do not use local volumes and instead [boot directly on block volumes](#boot-on-block).

## Placement groups

Placement groups distribute Compute Instances across different physical hypervisors to optimize availability (`max_availability`) or reduce network latency (`low_latency`). [Learn more](/instances/how-to/use-placement-groups/).

## Production-Optimized Instances

[Production-Optimized Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/production-optimized-instances/) (POP2) provide dedicated compute resources for high-performance workloads. Variants include:

- **POP2**: Block Storage-based Instances.
- **POP2-HC**: High-memory Instances (vCPU:RAM 1:8).
- **POP2-HM**: Balanced memory Instances (vCPU:RAM 1:2).
- **POP2-HN**: High-network Instances (vCPU:RAM 1:2, up to 10 Gbps bandwidth).

## Private Networks

Private Networks enable secure, isolated communication between Instances without internet access. [Learn more](/instances/how-to/use-private-networks/).

## Security groups

Security groups [control inbound and outbound traffic](/instances/how-to/use-security-groups/). They can be:

- **Stateful**: Allows return traffic for initiated connections.
- **Stateless**: Enforces strict inbound/outbound rules regardless of connection origin.

<Message type="note">
  Security groups filter **public** traffic only. Use a firewall (e.g., `iptables`) to control Private Network traffic.
</Message>

## Snapshot

A snapshot is a point-in-time backup of a specific volume. Unlike images, which capture entire Instances, snapshots allow granular control over volume backups. [Learn more](/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/).

## Tags

Tags help organize, filter, and monitor cloud resources efficiently. Multiple tags can be assigned to each Scaleway product.

## Volumes

Scaleway offers two volume types:

- **Local volumes**: Fixed-size SSD storage hosted on the local hypervisor.
- **Block volumes**: Network-attached storage that can be attached/detached like a virtual disk.

For more details, refer to [Block Volumes](#block-volumes) and [Local Volumes](#local-volumes).
