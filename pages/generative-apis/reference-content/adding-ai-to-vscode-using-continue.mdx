AI-powered coding is revolutionizing the way we develop software. With the help of machine learning models, developers can automate repetitive tasks, generate code, and even fix bugs. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to integrate AI-powered code models with VS Code using Continue and Scaleway's Generative APIs.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) for API authentication
- Installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your local machine
* Installed Continue in your VS Code marketplace

## Install Continue in VS Code
If you haven't already, install Continue in your VS Code marketplace:

* [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)

## Configure Scaleway as an API Provider in Continue
Continue's `config.json` file will set models and providers allowed for chat, autocompletion, etc. Here is an example configuration with Scaleway's OpenAI-compatible provider:
```json
"models": [
    {
      "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
      "title": "Qwen2.5-coder",
      "provider": "scaleway",
      "apiKey": "###SCW SECRET KEY###"
    }
]
```
<Message type="tip">
The config.json file is typically stored as `~/.continue/config.json` on Linux/macOS systems, and `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.json` on Windows.
</Message>

Read more about how to set up your `config.json` on the [official Continue documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/reference).

## Use AI-powered code models in VS Code
With Continue and Scaleway's Generative APIs configured, you can now access AI-powered code models in VS Code. Here are some examples of what you can do:

* Generate code: Use the code models to generate boilerplate code, functions, or even entire classes.
* Fix bugs: Let the code models help you fix bugs and errors in your code.
* Automate tasks: Use the code models to automate repetitive tasks, such as code formatting or refactoring.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we showed you how to integrate AI-powered code models with VS Code using Continue and Scaleway's Generative APIs. With this powerful combination, you can take your coding experience to the next level and automate many tasks. Try it out today and see the difference for yourself!
