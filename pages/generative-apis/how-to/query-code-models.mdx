Code models are AI-powered tools that can understand, generate, and fix code. With Scaleway's Generative APIs, you can access these code models and integrate them with your favorite IDEs.

### Install Continue in your IDE
[Continue](https://www.continue.dev/) is an open-source code assistant that connects AI models to your IDE. To get Continue, simply hit `install` in your IDE's marketplace:

* [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)
* [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue)

## Integrating with VS Code and Continue
To get started with code models, you'll need to integrate Scaleway's Generative APIs with your IDE. Here's a step-by-step guide to integrating Continue with VS Code:

1. Install the Continue extension from the VS Code marketplace or by running the command `code --install-extension continue.continue` in your terminal.
2. Create a `config.json` file in the `.continue` directory with your preferred models and API keys.
3. Open the Command Palette in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) and type "Continue" to access the extension's features.

### Using Continue with VS Code
Continue can be used with VS Code to automate tasks, generate code, and enhance your coding experience. Here are some examples of how to use Continue with VS Code:

* **Code generation**: Use the "Continue: Generate Code" command to generate boilerplate code, functions, or entire classes.
* **Code completion**: Use the "Continue: Complete Code" command to complete partially written code.
* **Code refactoring**: Use the "Continue: Refactor Code" command to refactor code and improve its readability and maintainability.

### Configure Scaleway as an API Provider in Continue
Continue's `config.json` file will set models and providers allowed for chat, autocompletion, etc. Here is an example configuration with Scaleway's OpenAI-compatible provider:
```json
"models": [
    {
      "model": "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct",
      "title": "Qwen2.5-coder",
      "provider": "scaleway",
      "apiKey": "###SCW SECRET KEY###"
    }
]
```
<Message type="tip">
The config.json file is typically stored as `~/.continue/config.json` on Linux/macOS systems, and `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.json` on Windows.
