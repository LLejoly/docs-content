If your Edge Services pipeline points towards a Load Balancer origin, you can choose to enable the **W**eb **A**pplication **F**irewall (WAF) feature, for added protection. This documentation page gives a detailed overview of WAF, and the different settings, modes and functionalities available.

## WAF overview

When enabled, WAF protects your Load Balancer backend from potential threats.

It does so by evaluating each request to your Load Balancer origin, to determine whether it is potentially malicious. Four different rulesets can be used to evaluate requests, each more aggressive than the last. The ruleset to use is determined by the **paranoia level** set by the user.

For requests judged to be malicious, WAF can either block them from passing to your origin, or simply log them but allow them to pass, depending on the settings you choose.

You can set **exclusions**, so that certain requests are not evaluated by WAF and are allowed to pass directly to your Load Balancer origin. Exclusion filters are based on the request path and/or HTTP request type.

## WAF in an Edge Services pipeline

In an Edge Services pipeline, WAF sits before the origin stage. This means that WAF only protects your origin, it does not protect or filter requests towards the cache.

## WAF limitations

- WAF is only compatible with Load Balancer origins. It cannot be enabled for Object Storage bucket origins.
- WAF protects your origin only, and not your cache.
- You can add a maximum of 100 WAF exclusions
