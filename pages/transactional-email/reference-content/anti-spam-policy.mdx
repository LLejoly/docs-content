<Message type="note">
  The content of this page is a word-for-word transcription of Scaleway Transaction Email's official Anti-spam policy.
</Message>

By using service “Transactional Email” or “TEM”, you acknowledge and agree with the following obligations described hereinafter. With the “TEM” service you can only send Transactional Emails.

## What is a Transactional Email?

A Transactional Email is an automatic email sent to a single recipient to confirm a transaction or an event (for instance: password recovery, e-bills, billing information, delivery updates,...).

Unlike marketing emails, Transactional Email is triggered by events, interactions or preferences within a service or application rather than by a company's marketing campaign. For this reason, Transactional Emails are also called “triggered emails”.

These emails are mainly “operational” and provide an update to a request made by the recipient. In other words, these are emails that the recipient expects to receive and in many cases the recipient updates its inbox until he receives them.

Unlike marketing emails, which are mass distributions of the same marketing message to multiple recipients simultaneously, Transactional Emails are personalized emails sent to a specific recipient in response to event it have triggered.

n order to send Transactional Email for the use of your application or your service, your processing of personal data is based on a legal basis in accordance with the application regulations (such as legitimate interest).

## What is “spam”?
A spam is unsolicited or unwanted email, most often of a commercial nature. In other words, it is any email sent to a recipient who has not given you its explicit prior consent or where you have no other legal basis to contact this recipient by email.

## What kind of recipient is not appropriate for sending emails with TEM service?
You cannot send emails with TEM service to an email address that you have bought, lent, rented or otherwise acquired from a third party.

If you send marketing emails such as a newsletter, or mass mailings, you must use other solutions or service adapted to this kind of email. In these cases, it is necessary to obtain the prior consent of the recipients.

## What are the consequences of not complying with this policy?
In accordance with our Terms of Service, in the event that we notice an irregular use of the TEM service and in particular when your domain name is registered in a black list or you have a high bounce rate, we reserve the right to suspend the service and your account.

Scaleway may, at its sole discretion, to decide whether bounce rate and/or third-party spam complaints are considered high. We may also require you to provide evidence that you have a legal basis under applicable law and suspend your account if you do not.

In case of suspension of the service, you acknowledge that no refund of amounts previously paid will be made.
