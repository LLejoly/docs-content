The Transactional Email blocklist feature allows your to manage email addresses that generate errors, or “bounces”. This helps you improve the quality of your email deliveries, maintain your domain's reputation score, and reduce the risk of having your domains blocked by ISPs.

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Configured your domain(s) with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email/)

## How to add an email address to the blocklist

Manually adding an email address to a domain's blocklist is only available for users who have a Scaleway domain.
When you add an email to the blocklist, it will remain block indefinitely unless you decide to [unblock it](#how-to-unblock-an-email-adress).

Avoid sending emails to recipients who have unsubscribed from your list.

Exclude addresses identified as inactive or irrelevant.

Addresses added manually will remain blocked until you decide to remove them.

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu. Your domains display.
2. Click the domain for which you want to manage the blocklist. An overview of your domain appears.
3. Click the **Blocklist** tab.

## How to manage temporary blocklists

If any of your emails were bounced, you will see a temporary blocklist, with a duration of 48h, with the details of the email that bounced and the reason. Some examples of bounce reasons are: `Mailbox not found`, when mailbox does not exist, and `Mailbox full`, when the mailbox is full.

The temporary blocklist is created automatically to prevent repeated attempts to send e-mails, which could damage your reputation.
