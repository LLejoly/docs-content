## What is InterLink?

InterLink is Scaleway's product to let you create a secure, private connection between your external infrastructure, and your Scaleway VPC. This allows you to direct your traffic safely from your Scaleway infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure, away from the public internet.

Currently, InterLink is available in **hosted** version only. This means that you must choose a compatible [partner](/network/interlink/concepts/#partner) to facilitate the physical connection between the external infrastructure and the Scaleway VPC. The physical connection may be shared between several clients, each allocated a specific amount of bandwidth for their InterLink.

For more information on how InterLink works, see our [detailed overview](/network/ipam/reference-content/overview/).
