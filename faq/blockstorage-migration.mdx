Scaleway is transitioning the management of Block Storage volumes and snapshots from the **Instance API** to the **Block Storage API**. This migration enhances performance, scalability, and provides access to new features. Below are the most frequently asked questions regarding this transition.

## What is changing with the migration?

The management of Block Storage **volumes and snapshots** is moving from the Instance API to the Block Storage API. After the migration:

* All your **volumes and snapshots** will be fully managed through the Block Storage API.
* **New features** and improvements will be available for your volumes, such as resizing and enhanced performance.
* The existing **Instance API** will no longer handle volume and snapshot operations.

## How do I migrate my existing volumes or snapshots?

For a step-by-step guide, visit [How to migrate volumes and snapshots](/instances/how-to/migrate-volumes-snapshots-to-sbs/).

## What happens if I do not migrate my unified volumes or snapshots?

To ensure continued access to managing your volumes, you must convert your **unified volumes and snapshots** into either **local** or **Block volumes** before the **end-of-life date of June 2nd, 2025**. After this date, unified volumes and snapshots will no longer be supported by any API.

### Key migration deadlines:

* April 30th, 2025:
	+ Creation of new unified volumes via the Instance API will be disabled.
	+ Unified volumes will no longer be supported by the Instance API.
* June 2nd, 2025:
	+ Unified volumes and snapshots **can no longer be managed via any API**. Existing unified resources must be converted by this date to avoid loss of manageability.

## Will there be any downtime during the migration?

There will be no downtime if you migrate your existing volumes to the Block Storage API, however only the volume's representation is migrated to the SBS API; the data itself does not move.

<Message type="note">
  This means the migrated volume will not benefit from low latency or higher IOPS, as it **retains the original `b_ssd` characteristics**.
</Message>

To convert an existing volume to the new Block Storage Low Latency, you can use the [snapshot export/import feature](/instances/how-to/migrate-volumes-snapshots-to-sbs/#migrating-using-the-snapshot-exportimport-features), however this manual process may result in downtime during the volume replacement.

## Will migration affect my billing?

The migration itself is **free**, but after migrating, your volumes will be billed according to the [Block Storage pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/block-storage/pricing/).

## How can I convert a Block Storage legacy volume into a Block Storage Low Latency volume?

Although there is no direct way to change the storage class of a volume while preserving its ID, you can still convert a Block Storage legacy volume (along with its data) into a Block Storage Low Latency volume using the snapshot export/import features as a temporary solution. This allows you to transition a Block Storage legacy (`b_ssd`) snapshot into a Block Storage Low Latency (`sbs_5k` or `sbs_15k`) snapshot and then turn the snapshot into a Block Storage Low Latency volume.

<Message type="important">
  The process below requires manual intervention and **does not preserve the original volume's ID**.
</Message>

While this approach allows you to transition to a Block Storage Low Latency volume, it is only a workaround.

1. [Create a snapshot of your Block Storage legacy volume](/instances/how-to/create-a-snapshot/).
2. [Export the snapshot](/instances/api-cli/snapshot-import-export-feature/#exporting-snapshots).
3. [Import the snapshot into a new Low Latency volume](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/#path-snapshot-import-a-snapshot-from-a-scaleway-object-storage-bucket).
