## Why should you use Scaleway Key Manager?

Key Manager helps organizations achieve secure key management by handling low-level and error-prone cryptographic details for you.


## What features does Scaleway Key Manager include?

Scaleway Key Manager allows you to create, manage and use cryptographic keys in a centralized and secure service. All your cryptographic operations can be delegated to Key Manager, which in turn ensures the security and availability of your keys.

## Which management methods can I use with Key Manager?

Key Manager allows you to create and manage the complete lifecycle of a key. Below are all the ways you can use Key Manager to manage your data.

### Create a key:

You must specify a **key usage**, which defines the **purpose of the key** (encryption, signing, etc.) and which **cryptographic algorithm** will be used to derive the key. Upon key creation, a first key version is also automatically created.

### Retrieve a key:

Retrieving a key **only returns the metadata associated with the key**. The key versions will not be returned when retrieving a key.

### List keys:

You can retrieve a subset of your keys according to filters such as "name", "description", "tags", etc.

### Update a key:

You can update the key's name, description or tags at any time.

### Enable and disable key protection:

**Enabling key protection prevents any accidental deletion of a key**. You must disable key protection before deleting a key to which key protection is applied.

### Rotate a key:

Rotating a key **creates a new key version and makes all previous versions obsolete**.

### Delete a key:

Deleting a key also **deletes all its versions**.


## Which cryptographic operations does Key Manager support?

At the moment, Scaleway's Key Manager supports the three following cryptographic operations.

| Encrypt data using the latest version of the Key Manager key. The encryption algorithm used is the one defined when setting the key usage.  Only keys with a usage set to `symmetric_encryption` are supported by this method. The input data is arbitrary, but this endpoint should only be used only to encrypt data encryption keys, not actual payloads. [Find out how to encrypt and decrypt payloads using The Scaleway Tink provider](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/api-cli/manage-keys-with-tink) | This operation lets you decrypt an encrypted payload. **The only way to decrypt an encrypted payload is by using the `Decrypt` endpoint. Since key versions never leave Key Manager, there is no other way to decrypt data outside Key Manager.**  A payload encrypted with an older key version can still be decrypted. In this case, for convenience, the payload encrypted with the latest key version will be returned, along with the decrypted payload. | Generate a symmetric [data encryption key](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/concepts/#data-encryption-key-(dek)) (DEK) that can be used outside Key Manager to encrypt and decrypt payloads. This DEK is encrypted with a key encryption key, specified by the caller.  **The management of the DEK is the responsibility of the caller. The DEK should be stored safely and have the same lifecycle as the payload it encrypts.** |

## Which algorithms and key usage does Key Manager support?

Key Manager **only supports symmetric encryption as of yet**.

Keys with a [key usage](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/concepts/#key-usage) set to `symmetric_encryption` are **used to encrypt and decrypt data**.

Key Manager currently **only supports the `AES-256-GCM` key algorithm**. Refer to our [dedicated documentation](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/reference-content/understanding-key-manager/) to find out which parameters (in compliance with the [recommendations of ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/mecanismes-cryptographiques)) are used when creating and using a key with the `AES-256 GCM` [symmetric encryption](/identity-and-access-management/key-manager/concepts/#symmetric-encryption) algorithm.
